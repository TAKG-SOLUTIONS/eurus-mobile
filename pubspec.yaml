  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - images/avatar.png
    - images/splash_icon_red.png
    - images/splash_icon_black.png
    - images/cogwheel.png
    - images/coin-simple-logo.png
    - images/coin-simple-logo-black.png
    - images/yakka-coin.png
    - images/yakka-coin-white.png
    - images/bitcoin.png
    - images/ethereum.png
    - images/wallet icon.png
    - images/home_banner.png
    - images/buy_crypto_banner.png
    - images/trades_banner.png

  #   - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: Poppins
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/Poppins-Light.ttf
